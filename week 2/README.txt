Description: Read-Me file for the following programs:
1. merge4sort
2. merge4Time

All programs should be ran in a unix terminal such as the school server. 
A make file is provided for all programs individually. 
Simply enter the respective folder for the program, type "make", and the program executable will 
be compiled. 

The program merge4sort can be ran without any command line arguments provided the data.txt file is in the directory.

The programs mergeTime and insertTime require a command line integer argument that is used to determine the size of the random array to be
generated. The following examples show how to run this in unix: 
	"user/directory merge4Time 4 " will produce an array with 4 random values, and 
	"user/directory merge4Time 6 "  will produce an array with 6 random values.
