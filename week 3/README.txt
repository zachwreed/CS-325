All programs should be ran in a unix terminal such as the school server. 
A make file is provided for all programs individually. 
Simply enter the respective folder for the program, type "make", and the program executable will 
be compiled. 

The program can be ran without any command line arguments provided the shopping.txt file is in the directory.
