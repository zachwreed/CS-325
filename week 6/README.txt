Description: Read-Me file for wrestlers

The program should be ran in a unix terminal such as the school server. 
A makefile is provided for all programs individually. 
Simply enter the respective folder for the program, type "make", and the program executable will 
be compiled. 

The program requires a command line .txt file argument. The following examples show how to run this in unix: 
	"user/directory wrestler wrestler.txt "
	"user/directory wrestler wrestler1.txt "

I tested my program during 2/16/2019 on Flip. The executable file compiled correctly on flip as it does in my development environment Visual Studio. 
As of 2/17/2019 the executable is giving erroneous output even with simple output "string" to terminal statements. I recommend if able to run this 
in an IDE of choice if possible as it seems something is wrong with Flip. During the time between those two days, I only added comments to my file.
